# Photo Beats
This project was inspired by my love of photography and art, but my complete disdain for producing reels and short video content.  I wanted to be able to upload my photos and an audio track and get a video, in sync, in return.  

1. Upload your photos as png or jpg files
2. Upload an audio track as an mp3 or wav
3. Click submit and allow time to process
4. Review your final video and download if you like it!
